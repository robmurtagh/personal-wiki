# zsh

I use [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) as my primary shell.

## Turn on completions

Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions/blob/master/INSTALL.md#oh-my-zsh) to install command history tab complete.

## Turn off git branch prompts

```sh
git config --global oh-my-zsh.hide-status 1
```
