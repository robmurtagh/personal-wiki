## What notes I keep

Welcome to my personal wiki where keep a record of things I don't find obvious in my day-to-day work. Most of the notes here relate to software development on a Mac computer.


## How this site works

I keep notes in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) format, and build them as documentation pages using [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/). You can find the published wiki [here](https://wiki.robmurtagh.com/) and the corresponding Github repo [here](https://github.com/robmurtagh/personal-wiki).

Please feel free to make a [Github pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) if you think I could make any corrections or improvements.
