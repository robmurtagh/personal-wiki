# Personal Wiki

Hi, I'm Rob. Thanks for visiting. I'm a full-stack software developer and these are my notes.

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/robmurtagh), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rjmurtagh), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3052692/rjmurt), or at my [personal website](https://www.robmurtagh.com/).

## What notes I keep

This site is a record of things I don't find obvious in my day-to-day work. They are intended as a memory prompt rather than a complete explanation. Most of the notes here relate to software development on a Mac computer.

## How this site works

I keep notes in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) format, and build them as documentation pages using [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/). You can find the published wiki [here](https://wiki.robmurtagh.com/) and the corresponding Github repo [here](https://github.com/robmurtagh/personal-wiki).

Please feel free to make a [Github pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) if you think I could make any corrections or improvements.
